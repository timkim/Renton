Renton
======================

Renton is a tool to build BlackBerry 10 native extensions from the command line.

The idea is to be able to build the .so files needed to deploy onto device/simulator without 
having to use the IDE.

##Requirements
You'll need to download the [BlackBerry 10 Native SDK](http://developer.blackberry.com/native/download/) to get this running. 
Then update the config file to point to the path of the native sdk. 

##Usage
    Renton --name <name> --srcDir <directory> --destDir <directory>
